Starting Home Manager activation
The previous generation number and path are in conflict! These
must be either both empty or both set but are now set to

    '13' and ''

If you don't mind losing previous profile generations then
the easiest solution is probably to run

   rm /home/chloe/.local/state/nix/profiles/home-manager*
   rm /home/chloe/.local/state/home-manager/gcroots/current-home

and trying home-manager switch again. Good luck!
